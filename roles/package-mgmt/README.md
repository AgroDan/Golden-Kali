Package Mgmt
=========

This role will handle any OS-level patching and package installs, including the installation of keys for repositories and such. This role typically takes a while to run because I always make sure I am patched and up to date before doing anything, and then of course the individual packages just take a while to install.

Role Variables
--------------

I have added the URLs to the specific keys I am using to install the repositories for things like Docker and Sublime Text.
